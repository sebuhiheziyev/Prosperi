            <div class="moneyback-text">
                <p>Generally, if you do not meet the conditions of our Money-back Guarantee set out below, all charges
                    for purchases are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable, and there are no refunds or credits for
                    partially used periods unless otherwise is stated herein or as required by applicable law for

                <p>Note for the subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area: If you are an EU resident, you
                    are entitled to a full refund without stating any reason within fourteen (14) days after the
                    subscription begins for the purchase of digital content. Please note that this 14-day period
                    commences when the subscription starts. The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of
                    the agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby
                    lose your right of withdrawal. YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE OF THE OF
                    THE AGREEMENT AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL FROM THE AGREEMENT ONCE

                    consecutive days within the first 31 days after the purchase, and
                    the user can demonstrate that he/she conscientiously has followed the plan (ex.: provide photos
                    and/or video of completion of recommendations, tasks, etc.)</p>
